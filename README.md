This website relies on 5 different API calls to allow you to Travel with your Team.

## Deployment 

This application can be found [here.](https://mattkrebs1974.github.io/Project-1/)

## User Experience

Upon load this App will require users to select a league and then a team that they wish to travel with. When the team is selected they have to select the game they would like to attend. Once they select the game they will be shown a list of events in and around the location of that game which they will travel to.
